                         The WebSocket Protocol

Abstract

   The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a clientrunning untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote hostthat has opted-in to communications from that code.  The securitymodel used for this is the origin-based security model commonly usedby web browsers.  The protocol consists of an opening handshakefollowed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The goal ofthis technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-basedapplications that need two-way communication with servers that doesnot rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., usingXMLHttpRequest or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   _This section is non-normative._

   Historically, creating web applications that need bidirectionalcommunication between a client and a server (e.g., instant messagingand gaming applications) has required an abuse of HTTP to poll theserver for updates while sending upstream notifications as distinctHTTP calls [RFC6202].

   This results in a variety of problems:

   o  The server is forced to use a number of different underlying TCP connections for each client: one for sending information to the client and a new one for each incoming message.

   o  The wire protocol has a high overhead, with each client-to-server message having an HTTP header.

   o  The client-side script is forced to maintain a mapping from the outgoing connections to the incoming connection to track replies.

   A simpler solution would be to use a single TCP connection fortraffic in both directions.  This is what the WebSocket Protocolprovides.  Combined with the WebSocket API [WSAPI], it provides analternative to HTTP polling for two-way communication from a web pageto a remote server.

   The same technique can be used for a variety of web applications:
   games, stock tickers, multiuser applications with simultaneousediting, user interfaces exposing server-side services in real time, etc.

   The WebSocket Protocol is designed to supersede existingbidirectional communication technologies that use HTTP as a transportlayer to benefit from existing infrastructure (proxies, filtering, authentication).  Such technologies were implemented as trade-offsbetween efficiency and reliability because HTTP was not initiallymeant to be used for bidirectional communication (see [RFC6202] forfurther discussion).  The WebSocket Protocol attempts to address thegoals of existing bidirectional HTTP technologies in the context ofthe existing HTTP infrastructure; as such, it is designed to workover HTTP ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies andintermediaries, even if this implies some complexity specific to thecurrent environment.  However, the design does not limit WebSocket toHTTP, and future implementations could use a simpler handshake over a   dedicated port without reinventing the entire protocol.  This lastpoint is important because the traffic patterns of interactivemessaging do not closely match standard HTTP traffic and can induceunusual loads on some components.

1.2.  Protocol Overview

   _This section is non-normative._

   The protocol has two parts: a handshake and the data transfer.

   The handshake from the client looks as follows:

        GET /chat HTTP/1.1 Host: server.example.com Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
        Origin: http://example.com Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

   The handshake from the server looks as follows:

        HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
        Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat

   The leading line from the client follows the Request-Line format.
   The leading line from the server follows the Status-Line format.  TheRequest-Line and Status-Line productions are defined in [RFC2616].

   An unordered set of header fields comes after the leading line inboth cases.  The meaning of these header fields is specified inSection 4 of this document.  Additional header fields may also bepresent, such as cookies [RFC6265].  The format and parsing ofheaders is as defined in [RFC2616].

   Once the client and server have both sent their handshakes, and ifthe handshake was successful, then the data transfer part starts.
   This is a two-way communication channel where each side can, independently from the other, send data at will.

   After a successful handshake, clients and servers transfer data backand forth in conceptual units referred to in this specification as "messages".  On the wire, a message is composed of one or more   frames.  The WebSocket message does not necessarily correspond to aparticular network layer framing, as a fragmented message may becoalesced or split by an intermediary.

   A frame has an associated type.  Each frame belonging to the samemessage contains the same type of data.  Broadly speaking, there aretypes for textual data (which is interpreted as UTF-8 [RFC3629] text), binary data (whose interpretation is left up to theapplication), and control frames (which are not intended to carrydata for the application but instead for protocol-level signaling, such as to signal that the connection should be closed).  Thisversion of the protocol defines six frame types and leaves tenreserved for future use.

1.3.  Opening Handshake

   _This section is non-normative._

   The opening handshake is intended to be compatible with HTTP-basedserver-side software and intermediaries, so that a single port can beused by both HTTP clients talking to that server and WebSocketclients talking to that server.  To this end, the WebSocket client'shandshake is an HTTP Upgrade request:

        GET /chat HTTP/1.1 Host: server.example.com Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
        Origin: http://example.com Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

   In compliance with [RFC2616], header fields in the handshake may besent by the client in any order, so the order in which differentheader fields are received is not significant.

   The "Request-URI" of the GET method [RFC2616] is used to identify theendpoint of the WebSocket connection, both to allow multiple domainsto be served from one IP address and to allow multiple WebSocketendpoints to be served by a single server.

   The client includes the hostname in the |Host| header field of itshandshake as per [RFC2616], so that both the client and the servercan verify that they agree on which host is in use.


   Additional header fields are used to select options in the WebSocketProtocol.  Typical options available in this version are thesubprotocol selector (|Sec-WebSocket-Protocol|), list of extensionssupport by the client (|Sec-WebSocket-Extensions|), |Origin| headerfield, etc.  The |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| request-header field can beused to indicate what subprotocols (application-level protocolslayered over the WebSocket Protocol) are acceptable to the client.
   The server selects one or none of the acceptable protocols and echoesthat value in its handshake to indicate that it has selected thatprotocol.

        Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat

   The |Origin| header field [RFC6454] is used to protect againstunauthorized cross-origin use of a WebSocket server by scripts usingthe WebSocket API in a web browser.  The server is informed of thescript origin generating the WebSocket connection request.  If theserver does not wish to accept connections from this origin, it canchoose to reject the connection by sending an appropriate HTTP errorcode.  This header field is sent by browser clients; for non-browserclients, this header field may be sent if it makes sense in thecontext of those clients.

   Finally, the server has to prove to the client that it received theclient's WebSocket handshake, so that the server doesn't acceptconnections that are not WebSocket connections.  This prevents anattacker from tricking a WebSocket server by sending it carefullycrafted packets using XMLHttpRequest [XMLHttpRequest] or a formsubmission.

   To prove that the handshake was received, the server has to take twopieces of information and combine them to form a response.  The firstpiece of information comes from the |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header fieldin the client handshake:

        Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==

   For this header field, the server has to take the value (as presentin the header field, e.g., the base64-encoded [RFC4648] version minusany leading and trailing whitespace) and concatenate this with theGlobally Unique Identifier (GUID, [RFC4122]) "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11" in string form, which is unlikely to be used bynetwork endpoints that do not understand the WebSocket Protocol.  ASHA-1 hash (160 bits) [FIPS.180-3], base64-encoded (see Section 4 of
   [RFC4648]), of this concatenation is then returned in the server'shandshake.

   Concretely, if as in the example above, the |Sec-WebSocket-Key|
   header field had the value "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==", the serverwould concatenate the string "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11" to form the string "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11".  The server would then take the SHA-1 hash of this, giving the value 0xb3 0x7a 0x4f 0x2c 0xc0 0x62 0x4f 0x16 0x90 0xf60x46 0x06 0xcf 0x38 0x59 0x45 0xb2 0xbe 0xc4 0xea.  This value isthen base64-encoded (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]), to give the value "s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=".  This value would then be echoed inthe |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| header field.

   The handshake from the server is much simpler than the clienthandshake.  The first line is an HTTP Status-Line, with the statuscode 101:

        HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols

   Any status code other than 101 indicates that the WebSocket handshakehas not completed and that the semantics of HTTP still apply.  Theheaders follow the status code.

   The |Connection| and |Upgrade| header fields complete the HTTPUpgrade.  The |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| header field indicates whetherthe server is willing to accept the connection.  If present, thisheader field must include a hash of the client's nonce sent in |Sec-WebSocket-Key| along with a predefined GUID.  Any other valuemust not be interpreted as an acceptance of the connection by theserver.

        HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=

   These fields are checked by the WebSocket client for scripted pages.
   If the |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| value does not match the expectedvalue, if the header field is missing, or if the HTTP status code isnot 101, the connection will not be established, and WebSocket frameswill not be sent.

   Option fields can also be included.  In this version of the protocol, the main option field is |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol|, which indicatesthe subprotocol that the server has selected.  WebSocket clientsverify that the server included one of the values that was specifiedin the WebSocket client's handshake.  A server that speaks multiplesubprotocols has to make sure it selects one based on the client'shandshake and specifies it in its handshake.
        Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat

   The server can also set cookie-related option fields to _set_cookies, as described in [RFC6265].

1.4.  Closing Handshake

   _This section is non-normative._

   The closing handshake is far simpler than the opening handshake.

   Either peer can send a control frame with data containing a specifiedcontrol sequence to begin the closing handshake (detailed inSection 5.5.1).  Upon receiving such a frame, the other peer sends aClose frame in response, if it hasn't already sent one.  Uponreceiving _that_ control frame, the first peer then closes theconnection, safe in the knowledge that no further data isforthcoming.

   After sending a control frame indicating the connection should beclosed, a peer does not send any further data; after receiving acontrol frame indicating the connection should be closed, a peerdiscards any further data received.

   It is safe for both peers to initiate this handshake simultaneously.

   The closing handshake is intended to complement the TCP closinghandshake (FIN/ACK), on the basis that the TCP closing handshake isnot always reliable end-to-end, especially in the presence ofintercepting proxies and other intermediaries.

   By sending a Close frame and waiting for a Close frame in response, certain cases are avoided where data may be unnecessarily lost.  Forinstance, on some platforms, if a socket is closed with data in thereceive queue, a RST packet is sent, which will then cause recv() tofail for the party that received the RST, even if there was datawaiting to be read.

1.5.  Design Philosophy

   _This section is non-normative._

   The WebSocket Protocol is designed on the principle that there shouldbe minimal framing (the only framing that exists is to make theprotocol frame-based instead of stream-based and to support adistinction between Unicode text and binary frames).  It is expectedthat metadata would be layered on top of WebSocket by the application layer, in the same way that metadata is layered on top of TCP by theapplication layer (e.g., HTTP).

   Conceptually, WebSocket is really just a layer on top of TCP thatdoes the following:

   o  adds a web origin-based security model for browsers

   o  adds an addressing and protocol naming mechanism to support multiple services on one port and multiple host names on one IP address

   o  layers a framing mechanism on top of TCP to get back to the IP packet mechanism that TCP is built on, but without length limits

   o  includes an additional closing handshake in-band that is designed to work in the presence of proxies and other intermediaries

   Other than that, WebSocket adds nothing.  Basically it is intended tobe as close to just exposing raw TCP to script as possible given theconstraints of the Web.  It's also designed in such a way that itsservers can share a port with HTTP servers, by having its handshakebe a valid HTTP Upgrade request.  One could conceptually use otherprotocols to establish client-server messaging, but the intent ofWebSockets is to provide a relatively simple protocol that cancoexist with HTTP and deployed HTTP infrastructure (such as proxies) and that is as close to TCP as is safe for use with suchinfrastructure given security considerations, with targeted additionsto simplify usage and keep simple things simple (such as the additionof message semantics).

   The protocol is intended to be extensible; future versions willlikely introduce additional concepts such as multiplexing.

1.6.  Security Model

   _This section is non-normative._

   The WebSocket Protocol uses the origin model used by web browsers torestrict which web pages can contact a WebSocket server when theWebSocket Protocol is used from a web page.  Naturally, when theWebSocket Protocol is used by a dedicated client directly (i.e., notfrom a web page through a web browser), the origin model is notuseful, as the client can provide any arbitrary origin string.

   This protocol is intended to fail to establish a connection withservers of pre-existing protocols like SMTP [RFC5321] and HTTP, whileallowing HTTP servers to opt-in to supporting this protocol if   desired.  This is achieved by having a strict and elaborate handshakeand by limiting the data that can be inserted into the connectionbefore the handshake is finished (thus limiting how much the servercan be influenced).

   It is similarly intended to fail to establish a connection when datafrom other protocols, especially HTTP, is sent to a WebSocket server, for example, as might happen if an HTML "form" were submitted to aWebSocket server.  This is primarily achieved by requiring that theserver prove that it read the handshake, which it can only do if thehandshake contains the appropriate parts, which can only be sent by aWebSocket client.  In particular, at the time of writing of thisspecification, fields starting with |Sec-| cannot be set by anattacker from a web browser using only HTML and JavaScript APIs suchas XMLHttpRequest [XMLHttpRequest].

   The WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol.  Itsonly relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted byHTTP servers as an Upgrade request.

   By default, the WebSocket Protocol uses port 80 for regular WebSocketconnections and port 443 for WebSocket connections tunneled overTransport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC2818].

1.8.  Establishing a Connection

   _This section is non-normative._

   When a connection is to be made to a port that is shared by an HTTPserver (a situation that is quite likely to occur with traffic toports 80 and 443), the connection will appear to the HTTP server tobe a regular GET request with an Upgrade offer.  In relatively simplesetups with just one IP address and a single server for all trafficto a single hostname, this might allow a practical way for systemsbased on the WebSocket Protocol to be deployed.  In more elaboratesetups (e.g., with load balancers and multiple servers), a dedicatedset of hosts for WebSocket connections separate from the HTTP serversis probably easier to manage.  At the time of writing of thisspecification, it should be noted that connections on ports 80 and443 have significantly different success rates, with connections onport 443 being significantly more likely to succeed, though this maychange with time.

1.9.  Subprotocols Using the WebSocket Protocol

   _This section is non-normative._

   The client can request that the server use a specific subprotocol byincluding the |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| field in its handshake.  If itis specified, the server needs to include the same field and one ofthe selected subprotocol values in its response for the connection tobe established.

   These subprotocol names should be registered as per Section 11.5.  Toavoid potential collisions, it is recommended to use names thatcontain the ASCII version of the domain name of the subprotocol'soriginator.  For example, if Example Corporation were to create aChat subprotocol to be implemented by many servers around the Web, they could name it "chat.example.com".  If the Example Organizationcalled their competing subprotocol "chat.example.org", then the twosubprotocols could be implemented by servers simultaneously, with theserver dynamically selecting which subprotocol to use based on thevalue sent by the client.

   Subprotocols can be versioned in backward-incompatible ways bychanging the subprotocol name, e.g., going from
   "bookings.example.net" to "v2.bookings.example.net".  Thesesubprotocols would be considered completely separate by WebSocketclients.  Backward-compatible versioning can be implemented byreusing the same subprotocol string but carefully designing theactual subprotocol to support this kind of extensibility.

2.  Conformance Requirements

   All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort thesesteps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.




   Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps MAYbe implemented in any manner, so long as the end result isequivalent.  (In particular, the algorithms defined in thisspecification are intended to be easy to follow and not intended tobe performant.)

2.1.  Terminology and Other Conventions

   _ASCII_ shall mean the character-encoding scheme defined in
   [ANSI.X3-4.1986].

   This document makes reference to UTF-8 values and uses UTF-8notational formats as defined in STD 63 [RFC3629].

   Key terms such as named algorithms or definitions are indicated like_this_.

   Names of header fields or variables are indicated like |this|.

   Variable values are indicated like /this/.

   This document references the procedure to _Fail the WebSocketConnection_.  This procedure is defined in Section 7.1.7.

   _Converting a string to ASCII lowercase_ means replacing allcharacters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (i.e., LATIN CAPITAL LETTERA to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) with the corresponding characters in therange U+0061 to U+007A (i.e., LATIN SMALL LETTER A to LATIN SMALLLETTER Z).

   Comparing two strings in an _ASCII case-insensitive_ manner meanscomparing them exactly, code point for code point, except that thecharacters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (i.e., LATIN CAPITAL LETTERA to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) and the corresponding characters in therange U+0061 to U+007A (i.e., LATIN SMALL LETTER A to LATIN SMALLLETTER Z) are considered to also match.

   The term "URI" is used in this document as defined in [RFC3986].

   When an implementation is required to _send_ data as part of theWebSocket Protocol, the implementation MAY delay the actualtransmission arbitrarily, e.g., buffering data so as to send fewer IPpackets.

   Note that this document uses both [RFC5234] and [RFC2616] variants ofABNF in different sections.

3.  WebSocket URIs

   This specification defines two URI schemes, using the ABNF syntaxdefined in RFC 5234 [RFC5234], and terminology and ABNF productionsdefined by the URI specification RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

          ws-URI = "ws:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path [ "?" query ]
          wss-URI = "wss:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path [ "?" query ]

          host = &lt;host, defined in [RFC3986], Section 3.2.2&gt;
          port = &lt;port, defined in [RFC3986], Section 3.2.3&gt;
          path = &lt;path-abempty, defined in [RFC3986], Section 3.3&gt;
          query = &lt;query, defined in [RFC3986], Section 3.4&gt;

   The port component is OPTIONAL; the default for "ws" is port 80, while the default for "wss" is port 443.

   The URI is called "secure" (and it is said that "the secure flag isset") if the scheme component matches "wss" case-insensitively.

   The "resource-name" (also known as /resource name/ in Section 4.1) can be constructed by concatenating the following:

   o  "/" if the path component is empty

   o  the path component

   o  "?" if the query component is non-empty

   o  the query component

   Fragment identifiers are meaningless in the context of WebSocket URIsand MUST NOT be used on these URIs.  As with any URI scheme, thecharacter "#", when not indicating the start of a fragment, MUST beescaped as %23.

4.  Opening Handshake

4.1.  Client Requirements

   To _Establish a WebSocket Connection_, a client opens a connectionand sends a handshake as defined in this section.  A connection isdefined to initially be in a CONNECTING state.  A client will need tosupply a /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and a /secure/ flag, whichare the components of a WebSocket URI as discussed in Section 3, along with a list of /protocols/ and /extensions/ to be used.
   Additionally, if the client is a web browser, it supplies /origin/.
   Clients running in controlled environments, e.g., browsers on mobilehandsets tied to specific carriers, MAY offload the management of theconnection to another agent on the network.  In such a situation, theclient for the purposes of this specification is considered toinclude both the handset software and any such agents.

   When the client is to _Establish a WebSocket Connection_ given a setof (/host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure/ flag), along with alist of /protocols/ and /extensions/ to be used, and an /origin/ inthe case of web browsers, it MUST open a connection, send an openinghandshake, and read the server's handshake in response.  The exactrequirements of how the connection should be opened, what should besent in the opening handshake, and how the server's response shouldbe interpreted are as follows in this section.  In the followingtext, we will use terms from Section 3, such as "/host/" and "/secure/ flag" as defined in that section.

   1.  The components of the WebSocket URI passed into this algorithm (/host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure/ flag) MUST be valid according to the specification of WebSocket URIs specified in Section 3.  If any of the components are invalid, the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_ and abort these steps.

   2.  If the client already has a WebSocket connection to the remote host (IP address) identified by /host/ and port /port/ pair, even if the remote host is known by another name, the client MUST wait until that connection has been established or for that connection to have failed.  There MUST be no more than one connection in a CONNECTING state.  If multiple connections to the same IP address are attempted simultaneously, the client MUST serialize them so that there is no more than one connection at a time running through the following steps.

       If the client cannot determine the IP address of the remote host (for example, because all communication is being done through a proxy server that performs DNS queries itself), then the client MUST assume for the purposes of this step that each host name refers to a distinct remote host, and instead the client SHOULD limit the total number of simultaneous pending connections to a reasonably low number (e.g., the client might allow simultaneous pending connections to a.example.com and b.example.com, but if thirty simultaneous connections to a single host are requested, that may not be allowed).  For example, in a web browser context, the client needs to consider the number of tabs the user has open in setting a limit to the number of simultaneous pending connections.

       NOTE: This makes it harder for a script to perform a denial-of-service attack by just opening a large number of WebSocket connections to a remote host.  A server can further reduce the load on itself when attacked by pausing before closing the connection, as that will reduce the rate at which the client reconnects.

       NOTE: There is no limit to the number of established WebSocket connections a client can have with a single remote host.  Servers can refuse to accept connections from hosts/IP addresses with an excessive number of existing connections or disconnect resource-hogging connections when suffering high load.

   3.  _Proxy Usage_: If the client is configured to use a proxy when using the WebSocket Protocol to connect to host /host/ and port /port/, then the client SHOULD connect to that proxy and ask it to open a TCP connection to the host given by /host/ and the port given by /port/.

          EXAMPLE: For example, if the client uses an HTTP proxy for all traffic, then if it was to try to connect to port 80 on server example.com, it might send the following lines to the proxy server:

              CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
              Host: example.com

          If there was a password, the connection might look like:

              CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
              Host: example.com
              Proxy-authorization: Basic ZWRuYW1vZGU6bm9jYXBlcyE=

       If the client is not configured to use a proxy, then a direct TCP connection SHOULD be opened to the host given by /host/ and the port given by /port/.

       NOTE: Implementations that do not expose explicit UI for selecting a proxy for WebSocket connections separate from other proxies are encouraged to use a SOCKS5 [RFC1928] proxy for WebSocket connections, if available, or failing that, to prefer the proxy configured for HTTPS connections over the proxy configured for HTTP connections.

       For the purpose of proxy autoconfiguration scripts, the URI to pass the function MUST be constructed from /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and the /secure/ flag using the definition of a WebSocket URI as given in Section 3.       NOTE: The WebSocket Protocol can be identified in proxy autoconfiguration scripts from the scheme ("ws" for unencrypted connections and "wss" for encrypted connections).

   4.  If the connection could not be opened, either because a direct connection failed or because any proxy used returned an error, then the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_ and abort the connection attempt.

   5.  If /secure/ is true, the client MUST perform a TLS handshake over the connection after opening the connection and before sending the handshake data [RFC2818].  If this fails (e.g., the server's certificate could not be verified), then the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_ and abort the connection.  Otherwise, all further communication on this channel MUST run through the encrypted tunnel [RFC5246].

       Clients MUST use the Server Name Indication extension in the TLS handshake [RFC6066].

   Once a connection to the server has been established (including aconnection via a proxy or over a TLS-encrypted tunnel), the clientMUST send an opening handshake to the server.  The handshake consistsof an HTTP Upgrade request, along with a list of required andoptional header fields.  The requirements for this handshake are asfollows.

   1.   The handshake MUST be a valid HTTP request as specified by [RFC2616].

   2.   The method of the request MUST be GET, and the HTTP version MUST be at least 1.1.

        For example, if the WebSocket URI is "ws://example.com/chat", the first line sent should be "GET /chat HTTP/1.1".

   3.   The "Request-URI" part of the request MUST match the /resource name/ defined in Section 3 (a relative URI) or be an absolute http/https URI that, when parsed, has a /resource name/, /host/, and /port/ that match the corresponding ws/wss URI.

   4.   The request MUST contain a |Host| header field whose value contains /host/ plus optionally ":" followed by /port/ (when not using the default port).

   5.   The request MUST contain an |Upgrade| header field whose value MUST include the "websocket" keyword.
   6.   The request MUST contain a |Connection| header field whose value MUST include the "Upgrade" token.

   7.   The request MUST include a header field with the name |Sec-WebSocket-Key|.  The value of this header field MUST be a nonce consisting of a randomly selected 16-byte value that has been base64-encoded (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]).  The nonce MUST be selected randomly for each connection.

        NOTE: As an example, if the randomly selected value was the sequence of bytes 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0a 0x0b 0x0c 0x0d 0x0e 0x0f 0x10, the value of the header field would be "AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEC=="

   8.   The request MUST include a header field with the name |Origin| [RFC6454] if the request is coming from a browser client.  If the connection is from a non-browser client, the request MAY include this header field if the semantics of that client match the use-case described here for browser clients.  The value of this header field is the ASCII serialization of origin of the context in which the code establishing the connection is running.  See [RFC6454] for the details of how this header field value is constructed.

        As an example, if code downloaded from www.example.com attempts to establish a connection to ww2.example.com, the value of the header field would be "http://www.example.com".

   9.   The request MUST include a header field with the name |Sec-WebSocket-Version|.  The value of this header field MUST be 13.

        NOTE: Although draft versions of this document (-09, -10, -11, and -12) were posted (they were mostly comprised of editorial changes and clarifications and not changes to the wire protocol), values 9, 10, 11, and 12 were not used as valid values for Sec-WebSocket-Version.  These values were reserved in the IANA registry but were not and will not be used.

   10.  The request MAY include a header field with the name |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol|.  If present, this value indicates one or more comma-separated subprotocol the client wishes to speak, ordered by preference.  The elements that comprise this value MUST be non-empty strings with characters in the range U+0021 to U+007E not including separator characters as defined in [RFC2616] and MUST all be unique strings.  The ABNF for the value of this header field is 1#token, where the definitions of constructs and rules are as given in [RFC2616].   11.  The request MAY include a header field with the name |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions|.  If present, this value indicates the protocol-level extension(s) the client wishes to speak.  The interpretation and format of this header field is described in Section 9.1.

   12.  The request MAY include any other header fields, for example, cookies [RFC6265] and/or authentication-related header fields such as the |Authorization| header field [RFC2616], which are processed according to documents that define them.

   Once the client's opening handshake has been sent, the client MUSTwait for a response from the server before sending any further data.
   The client MUST validate the server's response as follows:

   1.  If the status code received from the server is not 101, the client handles the response per HTTP [RFC2616] procedures.  In particular, the client might perform authentication if it receives a 401 status code; the server might redirect the client using a 3xx status code (but clients are not required to follow them), etc.  Otherwise, proceed as follows.

   2.  If the response lacks an |Upgrade| header field or the |Upgrade| header field contains a value that is not an ASCII case-insensitive match for the value "websocket", the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.

   3.  If the response lacks a |Connection| header field or the |Connection| header field doesn't contain a token that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the value "Upgrade", the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.

   4.  If the response lacks a |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| header field or the |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| contains a value other than the base64-encoded SHA-1 of the concatenation of the |Sec-WebSocket-Key| (as a string, not base64-decoded) with the string "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11" but ignoring any leading and trailing whitespace, the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.

   5.  If the response includes a |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field and this header field indicates the use of an extension that was not present in the client's handshake (the server has indicated an extension not requested by the client), the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.  (The parsing of this header field to determine which extensions are requested is discussed in Section 9.1.)
   
   6.  If the response includes a |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field and this header field indicates the use of a subprotocol that was not present in the client's handshake (the server has indicated a subprotocol not requested by the client), the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.

   If the server's response does not conform to the requirements for theserver's handshake as defined in this section and in Section 4.2.2, the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.

   Please note that according to [RFC2616], all header field names inboth HTTP requests and HTTP responses are case-insensitive.

   If the server's response is validated as provided for above, it issaid that _The WebSocket Connection is Established_ and that theWebSocket Connection is in the OPEN state.  The _Extensions In Use_is defined to be a (possibly empty) string, the value of which isequal to the value of the |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header fieldsupplied by the server's handshake or the null value if that headerfield was not present in the server's handshake.  The _Subprotocol InUse_ is defined to be the value of the |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field in the server's handshake or the null value if thatheader field was not present in the server's handshake.
   Additionally, if any header fields in the server's handshake indicatethat cookies should be set (as defined by [RFC6265]), these cookiesare referred to as _Cookies Set During the Server's OpeningHandshake_.

4.2.  Server-Side Requirements

   Servers MAY offload the management of the connection to other agentson the network, for example, load balancers and reverse proxies.  Insuch a situation, the server for the purposes of this specificationis considered to include all parts of the server-side infrastructurefrom the first device to terminate the TCP connection all the way tothe server that processes requests and sends responses.

   EXAMPLE: A data center might have a server that responds to WebSocketrequests with an appropriate handshake and then passes the connectionto another server to actually process the data frames.  For thepurposes of this specification, the "server" is the combination ofboth computers.





4.2.1.  Reading the Client's Opening Handshake

   When a client starts a WebSocket connection, it sends its part of theopening handshake.  The server must parse at least part of thishandshake in order to obtain the necessary information to generatethe server part of the handshake.

   The client's opening handshake consists of the following parts.  Ifthe server, while reading the handshake, finds that the client didnot send a handshake that matches the description below (note that asper [RFC2616], the order of the header fields is not important), including but not limited to any violations of the ABNF grammarspecified for the components of the handshake, the server MUST stopprocessing the client's handshake and return an HTTP response with anappropriate error code (such as 400 Bad Request).

   1.   An HTTP/1.1 or higher GET request, including a "Request-URI" [RFC2616] that should be interpreted as a /resource name/ defined in Section 3 (or an absolute HTTP/HTTPS URI containing the /resource name/).

   2.   A |Host| header field containing the server's authority.

   3.   An |Upgrade| header field containing the value "websocket", treated as an ASCII case-insensitive value.

   4.   A |Connection| header field that includes the token "Upgrade", treated as an ASCII case-insensitive value.

   5.   A |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header field with a base64-encoded (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]) value that, when decoded, is 16 bytes in length.

   6.   A |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field, with a value of 13.

   7.   Optionally, an |Origin| header field.  This header field is sent by all browser clients.  A connection attempt lacking this header field SHOULD NOT be interpreted as coming from a browser client.

   8.   Optionally, a |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field, with a list of values indicating which protocols the client would like to speak, ordered by preference.

   9.   Optionally, a |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field, with a list of values indicating which extensions the client would like to speak.  The interpretation of this header field is discussed in Section 9.1.   10.  Optionally, other header fields, such as those used to send cookies or request authentication to a server.  Unknown header fields are ignored, as per [RFC2616].

4.2.2.  Sending the Server's Opening Handshake

   When a client establishes a WebSocket connection to a server, theserver MUST complete the following steps to accept the connection andsend the server's opening handshake.

   1.  If the connection is happening on an HTTPS (HTTP-over-TLS) port, perform a TLS handshake over the connection.  If this fails (e.g., the client indicated a host name in the extended client hello "server_name" extension that the server does not host), then close the connection; otherwise, all further communication for the connection (including the server's handshake) MUST run through the encrypted tunnel [RFC5246].

   2.  The server can perform additional client authentication, for example, by returning a 401 status code with the corresponding |WWW-Authenticate| header field as described in [RFC2616].

   3.  The server MAY redirect the client using a 3xx status code [RFC2616].  Note that this step can happen together with, before, or after the optional authentication step described above.

   4.  Establish the following information:

       /origin/
          The |Origin| header field in the client's handshake indicates the origin of the script establishing the connection.  The origin is serialized to ASCII and converted to lowercase.  The server MAY use this information as part of a determination of whether to accept the incoming connection.  If the server does not validate the origin, it will accept connections from anywhere.  If the server does not wish to accept this connection, it MUST return an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g., 403 Forbidden) and abort the WebSocket handshake described in this section.  For more detail, refer to Section 10.

       /key/
          The |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header field in the client's handshake includes a base64-encoded value that, if decoded, is 16 bytes in length.  This (encoded) value is used in the creation of the server's handshake to indicate an acceptance of the connection.  It is not necessary for the server to base64-decode the |Sec-WebSocket-Key| value.
		  
	   /version/
          The |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field in the client's handshake includes the version of the WebSocket Protocol with which the client is attempting to communicate.  If this version does not match a version understood by the server, the server MUST abort the WebSocket handshake described in this section and instead send an appropriate HTTP error code (such as 426 Upgrade Required) and a |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field indicating the version(s) the server is capable of understanding.

       /resource name/
          An identifier for the service provided by the server.  If the server provides multiple services, then the value should be derived from the resource name given in the client's handshake in the "Request-URI" [RFC2616] of the GET method.  If the requested service is not available, the server MUST send an appropriate HTTP error code (such as 404 Not Found) and abort the WebSocket handshake.

       /subprotocol/
          Either a single value representing the subprotocol the server is ready to use or null.  The value chosen MUST be derived from the client's handshake, specifically by selecting one of the values from the |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| field that the server is willing to use for this connection (if any).  If the client's handshake did not contain such a header field or if the server does not agree to any of the client's requested subprotocols, the only acceptable value is null.  The absence of such a field is equivalent to the null value (meaning that if the server does not wish to agree to one of the suggested subprotocols, it MUST NOT send back a |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field in its response).  The empty string is not the same as the null value for these purposes and is not a legal value for this field.  The ABNF for the value of this header field is (token), where the definitions of constructs and rules are as given in [RFC2616].

       /extensions/
          A (possibly empty) list representing the protocol-level extensions the server is ready to use.  If the server supports multiple extensions, then the value MUST be derived from the client's handshake, specifically by selecting one or more of the values from the |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| field.  The absence of such a field is equivalent to the null value.  The empty string is not the same as the null value for these purposes.  Extensions not listed by the client MUST NOT be listed.  The method by which these values should be selected and interpreted is discussed in Section 9.1.

   5.  If the server chooses to accept the incoming connection, it MUST reply with a valid HTTP response indicating the following.

       1.  A Status-Line with a 101 response code as per RFC 2616 [RFC2616].  Such a response could look like "HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols".

       2.  An |Upgrade| header field with value "websocket" as per RFC 2616 [RFC2616].

       3.  A |Connection| header field with value "Upgrade".

       4.  A |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| header field.  The value of this header field is constructed by concatenating /key/, defined above in step 4 in Section 4.2.2, with the string "258EAFA5- E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11", taking the SHA-1 hash of this concatenated value to obtain a 20-byte value and base64- encoding (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]) this 20-byte hash.

           The ABNF [RFC2616] of this header field is defined as follows:

           Sec-WebSocket-Accept     = base64-value-non-empty
           base64-value-non-empty = (1*base64-data [ base64-padding ]) |
                                    base64-padding
           base64-data      = 4base64-character
           base64-padding   = (2base64-character "==") |
                              (3base64-character "=")
           base64-character = ALPHA | DIGIT | "+" | "/"

   NOTE: As an example, if the value of the |Sec-WebSocket-Key| headerfield in the client's handshake were "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==", theserver would append the string "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11"
   to form the string "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11".  The server would then take the SHA-1 hash of thisstring, giving the value 0xb3 0x7a 0x4f 0x2c 0xc0 0x62 0x4f 0x16 0x900xf6 0x46 0x06 0xcf 0x38 0x59 0x45 0xb2 0xbe 0xc4 0xea.  This valueis then base64-encoded, to give the value
   "s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=", which would be returned in the |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| header field.

       5.  Optionally, a |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field, with a value /subprotocol/ as defined in step 4 in Section 4.2.2.
       6.  Optionally, a |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field, with a value /extensions/ as defined in step 4 in Section 4.2.2.  If multiple extensions are to be used, they can all be listed in a single |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field or split between multiple instances of the |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field.

   This completes the server's handshake.  If the server finishes thesesteps without aborting the WebSocket handshake, the server considersthe WebSocket connection to be established and that the WebSocketconnection is in the OPEN state.  At this point, the server may beginsending (and receiving) data.

4.3.  Collected ABNF for New Header Fields Used in Handshake

   This section is using ABNF syntax/rules from Section 2.1 of [RFC2616], including the "implied *LWS rule".

   Note that the following ABNF conventions are used in this section.
   Some names of the rules correspond to names of the correspondingheader fields.  Such rules express values of the corresponding headerfields, for example, the Sec-WebSocket-Key ABNF rule describes syntaxof the |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header field value.  ABNF rules with the
   "-Client" suffix in the name are only used in requests sent by theclient to the server; ABNF rules with the "-Server" suffix in thename are only used in responses sent by the server to the client.
   For example, the ABNF rule Sec-WebSocket-Protocol-Client describessyntax of the |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field value sent by theclient to the server.

   The following new header fields can be sent during the handshake fromthe client to the server:

      Sec-WebSocket-Key = base64-value-non-empty Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list Sec-WebSocket-Protocol-Client = 1#token Sec-WebSocket-Version-Client = version

      base64-value-non-empty = (1*base64-data [ base64-padding ]) |
                                base64-padding base64-data      = 4base64-character base64-padding   = (2base64-character "==") |
                         (3base64-character "=")
      base64-character = ALPHA | DIGIT | "+" | "/"
      extension-list = 1#extension extension = extension-token *( ";" extension-param )
      extension-token = registered-token registered-token = token      extension-param = token [ "=" (token | quoted-string) ]
           ; When using the quoted-string syntax variant, the value
           ; after quoted-string unescaping MUST conform to the
           ; 'token' ABNF.
      NZDIGIT       =  "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" |
                       "7" | "8" | "9"
      version = DIGIT | (NZDIGIT DIGIT) |
                ("1" DIGIT DIGIT) | ("2" DIGIT DIGIT)
                ; Limited to 0-255 range, with no leading zeros

   The following new header fields can be sent during the handshake fromthe server to the client:

      Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list Sec-WebSocket-Accept     = base64-value-non-empty Sec-WebSocket-Protocol-Server = token Sec-WebSocket-Version-Server = 1#version

4.4.  Supporting Multiple Versions of WebSocket Protocol

   This section provides some guidance on supporting multiple versionsof the WebSocket Protocol in clients and servers.

   Using the WebSocket version advertisement capability (the |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field), a client can initially requestthe version of the WebSocket Protocol that it prefers (which doesn'tnecessarily have to be the latest supported by the client).  If theserver supports the requested version and the handshake message isotherwise valid, the server will accept that version.  If the serverdoesn't support the requested version, it MUST respond with a |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field (or multiple |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header fields) containing all versions it iswilling to use.  At this point, if the client supports one of theadvertised versions, it can repeat the WebSocket handshake using anew version value.

   The following example demonstrates version negotiation describedabove:

      GET /chat HTTP/1.1 Host: server.example.com Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade
      ...
      Sec-WebSocket-Version: 25


   The response from the server might look as follows:

      HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
      ...
      Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13, 8, 7

   Note that the last response from the server might also look like:

      HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
      ...
      Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13 Sec-WebSocket-Version: 8, 7

   The client now repeats the handshake that conforms to version 13:

      GET /chat HTTP/1.1 Host: server.example.com Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade
      ...
      Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

5.  Data Framing

5.1.  Overview

   In the WebSocket Protocol, data is transmitted using a sequence offrames.  To avoid confusing network intermediaries (such asintercepting proxies) and for security reasons that are furtherdiscussed in Section 10.3, a client MUST mask all frames that itsends to the server (see Section 5.3 for further details).  (Notethat masking is done whether or not the WebSocket Protocol is runningover TLS.)  The server MUST close the connection upon receiving aframe that is not masked.  In this case, a server MAY send a Closeframe with a status code of 1002 (protocol error) as defined inSection 7.4.1.  A server MUST NOT mask any frames that it sends tothe client.  A client MUST close a connection if it detects a maskedframe.  In this case, it MAY use the status code 1002 (protocolerror) as defined in Section 7.4.1.  (These rules might be relaxed ina future specification.)

   The base framing protocol defines a frame type with an opcode, apayload length, and designated locations for "Extension data" and "Application data", which together define the "Payload data". Certain bits and opcodes are reserved for future expansion of theprotocol.

   A data frame MAY be transmitted by either the client or the server atany time after opening handshake completion and before that endpointhas sent a Close frame (Section 5.5.1).

5.2.  Base Framing Protocol

   This wire format for the data transfer part is described by the ABNF [RFC5234] given in detail in this section.  (Note that, unlike inother sections of this document, the ABNF in this section isoperating on groups of bits.  The length of each group of bits isindicated in a comment.  When encoded on the wire, the mostsignificant bit is the leftmost in the ABNF).  A high-level overviewof the framing is given in the following figure.  In a case ofconflict between the figure below and the ABNF specified later inthis section, the figure is authoritative.

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   FIN:  1 bit

      Indicates that this is the final fragment in a message.  The first fragment MAY also be the final fragment.

   RSV1, RSV2, RSV3:  1 bit each

      MUST be 0 unless an extension is negotiated that defines meanings for non-zero values.  If a nonzero value is received and none of the negotiated extensions defines the meaning of such a nonzero value, the receiving endpoint MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.
   Opcode:  4 bits

      Defines the interpretation of the "Payload data".  If an unknown opcode is received, the receiving endpoint MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.  The following values are defined.

      *  %x0 denotes a continuation frame

      *  %x1 denotes a text frame

      *  %x2 denotes a binary frame

      *  %x3-7 are reserved for further non-control frames

      *  %x8 denotes a connection close

      *  %x9 denotes a ping

      *  %xA denotes a pong

      *  %xB-F are reserved for further control frames

   Mask:  1 bit

      Defines whether the "Payload data" is masked.  If set to 1, a masking key is present in masking-key, and this is used to unmask the "Payload data" as per Section 5.3.  All frames sent from client to server have this bit set to 1.

   Payload length:  7 bits, 7+16 bits, or 7+64 bits

      The length of the "Payload data", in bytes: if 0-125, that is the payload length.  If 126, the following 2 bytes interpreted as a 16-bit unsigned integer are the payload length.  If 127, the following 8 bytes interpreted as a 64-bit unsigned integer (the most significant bit MUST be 0) are the payload length.  Multibyte length quantities are expressed in network byte order.  Note that in all cases, the minimal number of bytes MUST be used to encode the length, for example, the length of a 124-byte-long string can't be encoded as the sequence 126, 0, 124.  The payload length is the length of the "Extension data" + the length of the "Application data".  The length of the "Extension data" may be zero, in which case the payload length is the length of the "Application data".



   Masking-key:  0 or 4 bytes

      All frames sent from the client to the server are masked by a 32-bit value that is contained within the frame.  This field is present if the mask bit is set to 1 and is absent if the mask bit is set to 0.  See Section 5.3 for further information on client-to-server masking.

   Payload data:  (x+y) bytes

      The "Payload data" is defined as "Extension data" concatenated with "Application data".

   Extension data:  x bytes

      The "Extension data" is 0 bytes unless an extension has been negotiated.  Any extension MUST specify the length of the "Extension data", or how that length may be calculated, and how the extension use MUST be negotiated during the opening handshake. If present, the "Extension data" is included in the total payload length.

   Application data:  y bytes

      Arbitrary "Application data", taking up the remainder of the frame after any "Extension data".  The length of the "Application data" is equal to the payload length minus the length of the "Extension data".

   The base framing protocol is formally defined by the following ABNF [RFC5234].  It is important to note that the representation of thisdata is binary, not ASCII characters.  As such, a field with a lengthof 1 bit that takes values %x0 / %x1 is represented as a single bitwhose value is 0 or 1, not a full byte (octet) that stands for thecharacters "0" or "1" in the ASCII encoding.  A field with a lengthof 4 bits with values between %x0-F again is represented by 4 bits, again NOT by an ASCII character or full byte (octet) with thesevalues.  [RFC5234] does not specify a character encoding: "Rulesresolve into a string of terminal values, sometimes calledcharacters.  In ABNF, a character is merely a non-negative integer.
   In certain contexts, a specific mapping (encoding) of values into acharacter set (such as ASCII) will be specified."  Here, thespecified encoding is a binary encoding where each terminal value isencoded in the specified number of bits, which varies for each field.

5.3.  Client-to-Server Masking

   A masked frame MUST have the field frame-masked set to 1, as definedin Section 5.2.

   The masking key is contained completely within the frame, as definedin Section 5.2 as frame-masking-key.  It is used to mask the "Payloaddata" defined in the same section as frame-payload-data, whichincludes "Extension data" and "Application data".

   The masking key is a 32-bit value chosen at random by the client.
   When preparing a masked frame, the client MUST pick a fresh maskingkey from the set of allowed 32-bit values.  The masking key needs tobe unpredictable; thus, the masking key MUST be derived from a strongsource of entropy, and the masking key for a given frame MUST NOTmake it simple for a server/proxy to predict the masking key for asubsequent frame.  The unpredictability of the masking key isessential to prevent authors of malicious applications from selectingthe bytes that appear on the wire.  RFC 4086 [RFC4086] discusses whatentails a suitable source of entropy for security-sensitiveapplications.

   The masking does not affect the length of the "Payload data".  Toconvert masked data into unmasked data, or vice versa, the followingalgorithm is applied.  The same algorithm applies regardless of thedirection of the translation, e.g., the same steps are applied tomask the data as to unmask the data.

   Octet i of the transformed data ("transformed-octet-i") is the XOR ofoctet i of the original data ("original-octet-i") with octet at indexi modulo 4 of the masking key ("masking-key-octet-j"):

     j                   = i MOD 4
     transformed-octet-i = original-octet-i XOR masking-key-octet-j

   The payload length, indicated in the framing as frame-payload-length, does NOT include the length of the masking key.  It is the length ofthe "Payload data", e.g., the number of bytes following the maskingkey.

5.4.  Fragmentation

   The primary purpose of fragmentation is to allow sending a messagethat is of unknown size when the message is started without having tobuffer that message.  If messages couldn't be fragmented, then anendpoint would have to buffer the entire message so its length couldbe counted before the first byte is sent.  With fragmentation, aserver or intermediary may choose a reasonable size buffer and, whenthe buffer is full, write a fragment to the network.

   A secondary use-case for fragmentation is for multiplexing, where itis not desirable for a large message on one logical channel tomonopolize the output channel, so the multiplexing needs to be free   to split the message into smaller fragments to better share theoutput channel.  (Note that the multiplexing extension is notdescribed in this document.)

   Unless specified otherwise by an extension, frames have no semanticmeaning.  An intermediary might coalesce and/or split frames, if noextensions were negotiated by the client and the server or if someextensions were negotiated, but the intermediary understood all theextensions negotiated and knows how to coalesce and/or split framesin the presence of these extensions.  One implication of this is thatin absence of extensions, senders and receivers must not depend onthe presence of specific frame boundaries.

   The following rules apply to fragmentation:

   o  An unfragmented message consists of a single frame with the FIN bit set (Section 5.2) and an opcode other than 0.

   o  A fragmented message consists of a single frame with the FIN bit clear and an opcode other than 0, followed by zero or more frames with the FIN bit clear and the opcode set to 0, and terminated by a single frame with the FIN bit set and an opcode of 0.  A fragmented message is conceptually equivalent to a single larger message whose payload is equal to the concatenation of the payloads of the fragments in order; however, in the presence of extensions, this may not hold true as the extension defines the interpretation of the "Extension data" present.  For instance, "Extension data" may only be present at the beginning of the first fragment and apply to subsequent fragments, or there may be "Extension data" present in each of the fragments that applies only to that particular fragment.  In the absence of "Extension data", the following example demonstrates how fragmentation works.

      EXAMPLE: For a text message sent as three fragments, the first fragment would have an opcode of 0x1 and a FIN bit clear, the second fragment would have an opcode of 0x0 and a FIN bit clear, and the third fragment would have an opcode of 0x0 and a FIN bit that is set.

   o  Control frames (see Section 5.5) MAY be injected in the middle of a fragmented message.  Control frames themselves MUST NOT be fragmented.

   o  Message fragments MUST be delivered to the recipient in the order sent by the sender.


   o  The fragments of one message MUST NOT be interleaved between the fragments of another message unless an extension has been negotiated that can interpret the interleaving.

   o  An endpoint MUST be capable of handling control frames in the middle of a fragmented message.

   o  A sender MAY create fragments of any size for non-control messages.

   o  Clients and servers MUST support receiving both fragmented and unfragmented messages.

   o  As control frames cannot be fragmented, an intermediary MUST NOT attempt to change the fragmentation of a control frame.

   o  An intermediary MUST NOT change the fragmentation of a message if any reserved bit values are used and the meaning of these values is not known to the intermediary.

   o  An intermediary MUST NOT change the fragmentation of any message in the context of a connection where extensions have been negotiated and the intermediary is not aware of the semantics of the negotiated extensions.  Similarly, an intermediary that didn't see the WebSocket handshake (and wasn't notified about its content) that resulted in a WebSocket connection MUST NOT change the fragmentation of any message of such connection.

   o  As a consequence of these rules, all fragments of a message are of the same type, as set by the first fragment's opcode.  Since control frames cannot be fragmented, the type for all fragments in a message MUST be either text, binary, or one of the reserved opcodes.

   NOTE: If control frames could not be interjected, the latency of aping, for example, would be very long if behind a large message.
   Hence, the requirement of handling control frames in the middle of afragmented message.

   IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: In the absence of any extension, a receiverdoesn't have to buffer the whole frame in order to process it.  Forexample, if a streaming API is used, a part of a frame can bedelivered to the application.  However, note that this assumptionmight not hold true for all future WebSocket extensions.



5.5.  Control Frames

   Control frames are identified by opcodes where the most significantbit of the opcode is 1.  Currently defined opcodes for control framesinclude 0x8 (Close), 0x9 (Ping), and 0xA (Pong).  Opcodes 0xB-0xF arereserved for further control frames yet to be defined.

   Control frames are used to communicate state about the WebSocket.
   Control frames can be interjected in the middle of a fragmentedmessage.

   All control frames MUST have a payload length of 125 bytes or lessand MUST NOT be fragmented.

5.5.1.  Close

   The Close frame contains an opcode of 0x8.

   The Close frame MAY contain a body (the "Application data" portion ofthe frame) that indicates a reason for closing, such as an endpointshutting down, an endpoint having received a frame too large, or anendpoint having received a frame that does not conform to the formatexpected by the endpoint.  If there is a body, the first two bytes ofthe body MUST be a 2-byte unsigned integer (in network byte order) representing a status code with value /code/ defined in Section 7.4.
   Following the 2-byte integer, the body MAY contain UTF-8-encoded datawith value /reason/, the interpretation of which is not defined bythis specification.  This data is not necessarily human readable butmay be useful for debugging or passing information relevant to thescript that opened the connection.  As the data is not guaranteed tobe human readable, clients MUST NOT show it to end users.

   Close frames sent from client to server must be masked as perSection 5.3.

   The application MUST NOT send any more data frames after sending aClose frame.

   If an endpoint receives a Close frame and did not previously send aClose frame, the endpoint MUST send a Close frame in response.  (Whensending a Close frame in response, the endpoint typically echos thestatus code it received.)  It SHOULD do so as soon as practical.  Anendpoint MAY delay sending a Close frame until its current message issent (for instance, if the majority of a fragmented message isalready sent, an endpoint MAY send the remaining fragments beforesending a Close frame).  However, there is no guarantee that theendpoint that has already sent a Close frame will continue to processdata.   After both sending and receiving a Close message, an endpointconsiders the WebSocket connection closed and MUST close theunderlying TCP connection.  The server MUST close the underlying TCPconnection immediately; the client SHOULD wait for the server toclose the connection but MAY close the connection at any time aftersending and receiving a Close message, e.g., if it has not received aTCP Close from the server in a reasonable time period.

   If a client and server both send a Close message at the same time, both endpoints will have sent and received a Close message and shouldconsider the WebSocket connection closed and close the underlying TCPconnection.

5.5.2.  Ping

   The Ping frame contains an opcode of 0x9.

   A Ping frame MAY include "Application data".

   Upon receipt of a Ping frame, an endpoint MUST send a Pong frame inresponse, unless it already received a Close frame.  It SHOULDrespond with Pong frame as soon as is practical.  Pong frames arediscussed in Section 5.5.3.

   An endpoint MAY send a Ping frame any time after the connection isestablished and before the connection is closed.

   NOTE: A Ping frame may serve either as a keepalive or as a means toverify that the remote endpoint is still responsive.

5.5.3.  Pong

   The Pong frame contains an opcode of 0xA.

   Section 5.5.2 details requirements that apply to both Ping and Pongframes.

   A Pong frame sent in response to a Ping frame must have identical "Application data" as found in the message body of the Ping framebeing replied to.

   If an endpoint receives a Ping frame and has not yet sent Pongframe(s) in response to previous Ping frame(s), the endpoint MAYelect to send a Pong frame for only the most recently processed Pingframe.


   A Pong frame MAY be sent unsolicited.  This serves as aunidirectional heartbeat.  A response to an unsolicited Pong frame isnot expected.

5.6.  Data Frames

   Data frames (e.g., non-control frames) are identified by opcodeswhere the most significant bit of the opcode is 0.  Currently definedopcodes for data frames include 0x1 (Text), 0x2 (Binary).  Opcodes0x3-0x7 are reserved for further non-control frames yet to bedefined.

   Data frames carry application-layer and/or extension-layer data.  Theopcode determines the interpretation of the data:

   Text

      The "Payload data" is text data encoded as UTF-8.  Note that a particular text frame might include a partial UTF-8 sequence; however, the whole message MUST contain valid UTF-8.  Invalid UTF-8 in reassembled messages is handled as described in Section 8.1.

   Binary

      The "Payload data" is arbitrary binary data whose interpretation is solely up to the application layer.

5.7.  Examples

   o  A single-frame unmasked text message

      *  0x81 0x05 0x48 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f (contains "Hello")

   o  A single-frame masked text message

      *  0x81 0x85 0x37 0xfa 0x21 0x3d 0x7f 0x9f 0x4d 0x51 0x58
         (contains "Hello")

   o  A fragmented unmasked text message

      *  0x01 0x03 0x48 0x65 0x6c (contains "Hel")

      *  0x80 0x02 0x6c 0x6f (contains "lo")



   o  Unmasked Ping request and masked Ping response

      *  0x89 0x05 0x48 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f (contains a body of "Hello", but the contents of the body are arbitrary)

      *  0x8a 0x85 0x37 0xfa 0x21 0x3d 0x7f 0x9f 0x4d 0x51 0x58
         (contains a body of "Hello", matching the body of the ping)

   o  256 bytes binary message in a single unmasked frame

      *  0x82 0x7E 0x0100 [256 bytes of binary data]

   o  64KiB binary message in a single unmasked frame

      *  0x82 0x7F 0x0000000000010000 [65536 bytes of binary data]

5.8.  Extensibility

   The protocol is designed to allow for extensions, which will addcapabilities to the base protocol.  The endpoints of a connectionMUST negotiate the use of any extensions during the openinghandshake.  This specification provides opcodes 0x3 through 0x7 and0xB through 0xF, the "Extension data" field, and the frame-rsv1, frame-rsv2, and frame-rsv3 bits of the frame header for use byextensions.  The negotiation of extensions is discussed in furtherdetail in Section 9.1.  Below are some anticipated uses ofextensions.  This list is neither complete nor prescriptive.

   o  "Extension data" may be placed in the "Payload data" before the
      "Application data".

   o  Reserved bits can be allocated for per-frame needs.

   o  Reserved opcode values can be defined.

   o  Reserved bits can be allocated to the opcode field if more opcode values are needed.

   o  A reserved bit or an "extension" opcode can be defined that allocates additional bits out of the "Payload data" to define larger opcodes or more per-frame bits.

6.  Sending and Receiving Data

6.1.  Sending Data

   To _Send a WebSocket Message_ comprising of /data/ over a WebSocketconnection, an endpoint MUST perform the following steps.   1.  The endpoint MUST ensure the WebSocket connection is in the OPEN state (cf. Sections 4.1 and 4.2.2.)  If at any point the state of the WebSocket connection changes, the endpoint MUST abort the following steps.

   2.  An endpoint MUST encapsulate the /data/ in a WebSocket frame as defined in Section 5.2.  If the data to be sent is large or if the data is not available in its entirety at the point the endpoint wishes to begin sending the data, the endpoint MAY alternately encapsulate the data in a series of frames as defined in Section 5.4.

   3.  The opcode (frame-opcode) of the first frame containing the data MUST be set to the appropriate value from Section 5.2 for data that is to be interpreted by the recipient as text or binary data.

   4.  The FIN bit (frame-fin) of the last frame containing the data MUST be set to 1 as defined in Section 5.2.

   5.  If the data is being sent by the client, the frame(s) MUST be masked as defined in Section 5.3.

   6.  If any extensions (Section 9) have been negotiated for the WebSocket connection, additional considerations may apply as per the definition of those extensions.

   7.  The frame(s) that have been formed MUST be transmitted over the underlying network connection.

6.2.  Receiving Data

   To receive WebSocket data, an endpoint listens on the underlyingnetwork connection.  Incoming data MUST be parsed as WebSocket framesas defined in Section 5.2.  If a control frame (Section 5.5) isreceived, the frame MUST be handled as defined by Section 5.5.  Uponreceiving a data frame (Section 5.6), the endpoint MUST note the /type/ of the data as defined by the opcode (frame-opcode) fromSection 5.2.  The "Application data" from this frame is defined asthe /data/ of the message.  If the frame comprises an unfragmentedmessage (Section 5.4), it is said that _A WebSocket Message Has BeenReceived_ with type /type/ and data /data/.  If the frame is part ofa fragmented message, the "Application data" of the subsequent dataframes is concatenated to form the /data/.  When the last fragment isreceived as indicated by the FIN bit (frame-fin), it is said that _AWebSocket Message Has Been Received_ with data /data/ (comprised ofthe concatenation of the "Application data" of the fragments) and type /type/ (noted from the first frame of the fragmented message).
   Subsequent data frames MUST be interpreted as belonging to a newWebSocket message.

   Extensions (Section 9) MAY change the semantics of how data is read, specifically including what comprises a message boundary.
   Extensions, in addition to adding "Extension data" before the "Application data" in a payload, MAY also modify the "Applicationdata" (such as by compressing it).

   A server MUST remove masking for data frames received from a clientas described in Section 5.3.

7.  Closing the Connection

7.1.  Definitions

7.1.1.  Close the WebSocket Connection

   To _Close the WebSocket Connection_, an endpoint closes theunderlying TCP connection.  An endpoint SHOULD use a method thatcleanly closes the TCP connection, as well as the TLS session, ifapplicable, discarding any trailing bytes that may have beenreceived.  An endpoint MAY close the connection via any meansavailable when necessary, such as when under attack.

   The underlying TCP connection, in most normal cases, SHOULD be closedfirst by the server, so that it holds the TIME_WAIT state and not theclient (as this would prevent it from re-opening the connection for 2maximum segment lifetimes (2MSL), while there is no correspondingserver impact as a TIME_WAIT connection is immediately reopened upona new SYN with a higher seq number).  In abnormal cases (such as nothaving received a TCP Close from the server after a reasonable amountof time) a client MAY initiate the TCP Close.  As such, when a serveris instructed to _Close the WebSocket Connection_ it SHOULD initiatea TCP Close immediately, and when a client is instructed to do thesame, it SHOULD wait for a TCP Close from the server.

   As an example of how to obtain a clean closure in C using Berkeleysockets, one would call shutdown() with SHUT_WR on the socket, callrecv() until obtaining a return value of 0 indicating that the peerhas also performed an orderly shutdown, and finally call close() onthe socket.




7.1.2.  Start the WebSocket Closing Handshake

   To _Start the WebSocket Closing Handshake_ with a status codeSection 7.4) /code/ and an optional close reason (Section 7.1.6) /reason/, an endpoint MUST send a Close control frame, as describedin Section 5.5.1, whose status code is set to /code/ and whose closereason is set to /reason/.  Once an endpoint has both sent andreceived a Close control frame, that endpoint SHOULD _Close theWebSocket Connection_ as defined in Section 7.1.1.

7.1.3.  The WebSocket Closing Handshake is Started

   Upon either sending or receiving a Close control frame, it is saidthat _The WebSocket Closing Handshake is Started_ and that theWebSocket connection is in the CLOSING state.

7.1.4.  The WebSocket Connection is Closed

   When the underlying TCP connection is closed, it is said that _TheWebSocket Connection is Closed_ and that the WebSocket connection isin the CLOSED state.  If the TCP connection was closed after theWebSocket closing handshake was completed, the WebSocket connectionis said to have been closed _cleanly_.

   If the WebSocket connection could not be established, it is also saidthat _The WebSocket Connection is Closed_, but not _cleanly_.

7.1.5.  The WebSocket Connection Close Code

   As defined in Sections 5.5.1 and 7.4, a Close control frame maycontain a status code indicating a reason for closure.  A closing ofthe WebSocket connection may be initiated by either endpoint, potentially simultaneously. _The WebSocket Connection Close Code_ isdefined as the status code (Section 7.4) contained in the first Closecontrol frame received by the application implementing this protocol.
   If this Close control frame contains no status code, _The WebSocketConnection Close Code_ is considered to be 1005.  If _The WebSocketConnection is Closed_ and no Close control frame was received by theendpoint (such as could occur if the underlying transport connectionis lost), _The WebSocket Connection Close Code_ is considered to be1006.

   NOTE: Two endpoints may not agree on the value of _The WebSocketConnection Close Code_.  As an example, if the remote endpoint sent aClose frame but the local application has not yet read the datacontaining the Close frame from its socket's receive buffer, and thelocal application independently decided to close the connection andsend a Close frame, both endpoints will have sent and received a   Close frame and will not send further Close frames.  Each endpointwill see the status code sent by the other end as _The WebSocketConnection Close Code_.  As such, it is possible that the twoendpoints may not agree on the value of _The WebSocket ConnectionClose Code_ in the case that both endpoints _Start the WebSocketClosing Handshake_ independently and at roughly the same time.

7.1.6.  The WebSocket Connection Close Reason

   As defined in Sections 5.5.1 and 7.4, a Close control frame maycontain a status code indicating a reason for closure, followed byUTF-8-encoded data, the interpretation of said data being left to theendpoints and not defined by this protocol.  A closing of theWebSocket connection may be initiated by either endpoint, potentiallysimultaneously. _The WebSocket Connection Close Reason_ is defined asthe UTF-8-encoded data following the status code (Section 7.4) contained in the first Close control frame received by theapplication implementing this protocol.  If there is no such data inthe Close control frame, _The WebSocket Connection Close Reason_ isthe empty string.

   NOTE: Following the same logic as noted in Section 7.1.5, twoendpoints may not agree on _The WebSocket Connection Close Reason_.

7.1.7.  Fail the WebSocket Connection

   Certain algorithms and specifications require an endpoint to _Failthe WebSocket Connection_.  To do so, the client MUST _Close theWebSocket Connection_, and MAY report the problem to the user (whichwould be especially useful for developers) in an appropriate manner.
   Similarly, to do so, the server MUST _Close the WebSocketConnection_, and SHOULD log the problem.

   If _The WebSocket Connection is Established_ prior to the point wherethe endpoint is required to _Fail the WebSocket Connection_, theendpoint SHOULD send a Close frame with an appropriate status codeSection 7.4) before proceeding to _Close the WebSocket Connection_.
   An endpoint MAY omit sending a Close frame if it believes the otherside is unlikely to be able to receive and process the Close frame, due to the nature of the error that led the WebSocket connection tofail in the first place.  An endpoint MUST NOT continue to attempt toprocess data (including a responding Close frame) from the remoteendpoint after being instructed to _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.

   Except as indicated above or as specified by the application layere.g., a script using the WebSocket API), clients SHOULD NOT closethe connection.
7.2.  Abnormal Closures

7.2.1.  Client-Initiated Closure

   Certain algorithms, in particular during the opening handshake, require the client to _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.  To do so, theclient MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_ as defined inSection 7.1.7.

   If at any point the underlying transport layer connection isunexpectedly lost, the client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.

   Except as indicated above or as specified by the application layere.g., a script using the WebSocket API), clients SHOULD NOT closethe connection.

7.2.2.  Server-Initiated Closure

   Certain algorithms require or recommend that the server _Abort theWebSocket Connection_ during the opening handshake.  To do so, theserver MUST simply _Close the WebSocket Connection_ (Section 7.1.1).

7.2.3.  Recovering from Abnormal Closure

   Abnormal closures may be caused by any number of reasons.  Suchclosures could be the result of a transient error, in which casereconnecting may lead to a good connection and a resumption of normaloperations.  Such closures may also be the result of a nontransientproblem, in which case if each deployed client experiences anabnormal closure and immediately and persistently tries to reconnect, the server may experience what amounts to a denial-of-service attackby a large number of clients trying to reconnect.  The end result ofsuch a scenario could be that the service is unable to recover in atimely manner or recovery is made much more difficult.

   To prevent this, clients SHOULD use some form of backoff when tryingto reconnect after abnormal closures as described in this section.

   The first reconnect attempt SHOULD be delayed by a random amount oftime.  The parameters by which this random delay is chosen are leftto the client to decide; a value chosen randomly between 0 and 5seconds is a reasonable initial delay though clients MAY choose adifferent interval from which to select a delay length based onimplementation experience and particular application.

   Should the first reconnect attempt fail, subsequent reconnectattempts SHOULD be delayed by increasingly longer amounts of time, using a method such as truncated binary exponential backoff.7.3.  Normal Closure of Connections

   Servers MAY close the WebSocket connection whenever desired.  ClientsSHOULD NOT close the WebSocket connection arbitrarily.  In eithercase, an endpoint initiates a closure by following the procedures to_Start the WebSocket Closing Handshake_ (Section 7.1.2).

7.4.  Status Codes

   When closing an established connection (e.g., when sending a Closeframe, after the opening handshake has completed), an endpoint MAYindicate a reason for closure.  The interpretation of this reason byan endpoint, and the action an endpoint should take given thisreason, are left undefined by this specification.  This specificationdefines a set of pre-defined status codes and specifies which rangesmay be used by extensions, frameworks, and end applications.  Thestatus code and any associated textual message are optionalcomponents of a Close frame.

7.4.1.  Defined Status Codes

   Endpoints MAY use the following pre-defined status codes when sendinga Close frame.

   1000

      1000 indicates a normal closure, meaning that the purpose for which the connection was established has been fulfilled.

   1001

      1001 indicates that an endpoint is "going away", such as a server going down or a browser having navigated away from a page.

   1002

      1002 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection due to a protocol error.

   1003

      1003 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection because it has received a type of data it cannot accept (e.g., an endpoint that understands only text data MAY send this if it receives a binary message).


   1004

      Reserved.  The specific meaning might be defined in the future.

   1005

      1005 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code in a Close control frame by an endpoint.  It is designated for use in applications expecting a status code to indicate that no status code was actually present.

   1006

      1006 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code in a Close control frame by an endpoint.  It is designated for use in applications expecting a status code to indicate that the connection was closed abnormally, e.g., without sending or receiving a Close control frame.

   1007

      1007 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection because it has received data within a message that was not consistent with the type of the message (e.g., non-UTF-8 [RFC3629]
      data within a text message).

   1008

      1008 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection because it has received a message that violates its policy.  This is a generic status code that can be returned when there is no other more suitable status code (e.g., 1003 or 1009) or if there is a need to hide specific details about the policy.

   1009

      1009 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection because it has received a message that is too big for it to process.

   1010

      1010 indicates that an endpoint (client) is terminating the connection because it has expected the server to negotiate one or more extension, but the server didn't return them in the response message of the WebSocket handshake.  The list of extensions that

      are needed SHOULD appear in the /reason/ part of the Close frame.
      Note that this status code is not used by the server, because it can fail the WebSocket handshake instead.

   1011

      1011 indicates that a server is terminating the connection because it encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

   1015

      1015 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code in a Close control frame by an endpoint.  It is designated for use in applications expecting a status code to indicate that the connection was closed due to a failure to perform a TLS handshake
      (e.g., the server certificate can't be verified).

7.4.2.  Reserved Status Code Ranges

   0-999

      Status codes in the range 0-999 are not used.

   1000-2999

      Status codes in the range 1000-2999 are reserved for definition by this protocol, its future revisions, and extensions specified in a permanent and readily available public specification.

   3000-3999

      Status codes in the range 3000-3999 are reserved for use by libraries, frameworks, and applications.  These status codes are registered directly with IANA.  The interpretation of these codes is undefined by this protocol.

   4000-4999

      Status codes in the range 4000-4999 are reserved for private use and thus can't be registered.  Such codes can be used by prior agreements between WebSocket applications.  The interpretation of these codes is undefined by this protocol.




8.  Error Handling

8.1.  Handling Errors in UTF-8-Encoded Data

   When an endpoint is to interpret a byte stream as UTF-8 but findsthat the byte stream is not, in fact, a valid UTF-8 stream, thatendpoint MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_.  This rule appliesboth during the opening handshake and during subsequent dataexchange.

9.  Extensions

   WebSocket clients MAY request extensions to this specification, andWebSocket servers MAY accept some or all extensions requested by theclient.  A server MUST NOT respond with any extension not requestedby the client.  If extension parameters are included in negotiationsbetween the client and the server, those parameters MUST be chosen inaccordance with the specification of the extension to which theparameters apply.

9.1.  Negotiating Extensions

   A client requests extensions by including a |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field, which follows the normal rules for HTTPheader fields (see [RFC2616], Section 4.2) and the value of theheader field is defined by the following ABNF [RFC2616].  Note thatthis section is using ABNF syntax/rules from [RFC2616], including the
   "implied *LWS rule".  If a value is received by either the client orthe server during negotiation that does not conform to the ABNFbelow, the recipient of such malformed data MUST immediately _Failthe WebSocket Connection_.

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list
         extension-list = 1#extension
         extension = extension-token *( ";" extension-param )
         extension-token = registered-token
         registered-token = token
         extension-param = token [ "=" (token | quoted-string) ]
             ;When using the quoted-string syntax variant, the value
             ;after quoted-string unescaping MUST conform to the
             ;'token' ABNF.






   Note that like other HTTP header fields, this header field MAY besplit or combined across multiple lines.  Ergo, the following areequivalent:

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: foo
         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: bar; baz=2

   is exactly equivalent to

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: foo, bar; baz=2

   Any extension-token used MUST be a registered token (seeSection 11.4).  The parameters supplied with any given extension MUSTbe defined for that extension.  Note that the client is only offeringto use any advertised extensions and MUST NOT use them unless theserver indicates that it wishes to use the extension.

   Note that the order of extensions is significant.  Any interactionsbetween multiple extensions MAY be defined in the documents definingthe extensions.  In the absence of such definitions, theinterpretation is that the header fields listed by the client in itsrequest represent a preference of the header fields it wishes to use, with the first options listed being most preferable.  The extensionslisted by the server in response represent the extensions actually inuse for the connection.  Should the extensions modify the data and/orframing, the order of operations on the data should be assumed to bethe same as the order in which the extensions are listed in theserver's response in the opening handshake.

   For example, if there are two extensions "foo" and "bar" and if theheader field |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| sent by the server has thevalue "foo, bar", then operations on the data will be made asbar(foo(data)), be those changes to the data itself (such ascompression) or changes to the framing that may "stack".

   Non-normative examples of acceptable extension header fields (notethat long lines are folded for readability):

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-stream
         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: mux; max-channels=4; flow-control,
          deflate-stream
         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: private-extension

   A server accepts one or more extensions by including a |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| header field containing one or moreextensions that were requested by the client.  The interpretation of

   any extension parameters, and what constitutes a valid response by aserver to a requested set of parameters by a client, will be definedby each such extension.

9.2.  Known Extensions

   Extensions provide a mechanism for implementations to opt-in toadditional protocol features.  This document doesn't define anyextension, but implementations MAY use extensions defined separately.

10.  Security Considerations

   This section describes some security considerations applicable to theWebSocket Protocol.  Specific security considerations are describedin subsections of this section.

10.1.  Non-Browser Clients

   The WebSocket Protocol protects against malicious JavaScript runninginside a trusted application such as a web browser, for example, bychecking of the |Origin| header field (see below).  See Section 1.6for additional details.  Such assumptions don't hold true in the caseof a more-capable client.

   While this protocol is intended to be used by scripts in web pages, it can also be used directly by hosts.  Such hosts are acting ontheir own behalf and can therefore send fake |Origin| header fields, misleading the server.  Servers should therefore be careful aboutassuming that they are talking directly to scripts from known originsand must consider that they might be accessed in unexpected ways.  Inparticular, a server should not trust that any input is valid.

   EXAMPLE: If the server uses input as part of SQL queries, all inputtext should be escaped before being passed to the SQL server, lestthe server be susceptible to SQL injection.

10.2.  Origin Considerations

   Servers that are not intended to process input from any web page butonly for certain sites SHOULD verify the |Origin| field is an originthey expect.  If the origin indicated is unacceptable to the server, then it SHOULD respond to the WebSocket handshake with a replycontaining HTTP 403 Forbidden status code.

   The |Origin| header field protects from the attack cases when theuntrusted party is typically the author of a JavaScript applicationthat is executing in the context of the trusted client.  The clientitself can contact the server and, via the mechanism of the |Origin|   header field, determine whether to extend those communicationprivileges to the JavaScript application.  The intent is not toprevent non-browsers from establishing connections but rather toensure that trusted browsers under the control of potentiallymalicious JavaScript cannot fake a WebSocket handshake.

10.3.  Attacks On Infrastructure (Masking)

   In addition to endpoints being the target of attacks via WebSockets, other parts of web infrastructure, such as proxies, may be thesubject of an attack.

   As this protocol was being developed, an experiment was conducted todemonstrate a class of attacks on proxies that led to the poisoningof caching proxies deployed in the wild [TALKING].  The general formof the attack was to establish a connection to a server under the "attacker's" control, perform an UPGRADE on the HTTP connectionsimilar to what the WebSocket Protocol does to establish aconnection, and subsequently send data over that UPGRADEd connectionthat looked like a GET request for a specific known resource (whichin an attack would likely be something like a widely deployed scriptfor tracking hits or a resource on an ad-serving network).  Theremote server would respond with something that looked like aresponse to the fake GET request, and this response would be cachedby a nonzero percentage of deployed intermediaries, thus poisoningthe cache.  The net effect of this attack would be that if a usercould be convinced to visit a website the attacker controlled, theattacker could potentially poison the cache for that user and otherusers behind the same cache and run malicious script on otherorigins, compromising the web security model.

   To avoid such attacks on deployed intermediaries, it is notsufficient to prefix application-supplied data with framing that isnot compliant with HTTP, as it is not possible to exhaustivelydiscover and test that each nonconformant intermediary does not skipsuch non-HTTP framing and act incorrectly on the frame payload.
   Thus, the defense adopted is to mask all data from the client to theserver, so that the remote script (attacker) does not have controlover how the data being sent appears on the wire and thus cannotconstruct a message that could be misinterpreted by an intermediaryas an HTTP request.

   Clients MUST choose a new masking key for each frame, using analgorithm that cannot be predicted by end applications that providedata.  For example, each masking could be drawn from acryptographically strong random number generator.  If the same key isused or a decipherable pattern exists for how the next key is chosen, the attacker can send a message that, when masked, could appear to be   an HTTP request (by taking the message the attacker wishes to see onthe wire and masking it with the next masking key to be used, themasking key will effectively unmask the data when the client appliesit).

   It is also necessary that once the transmission of a frame from aclient has begun, the payload (application-supplied data) of thatframe must not be capable of being modified by the application.
   Otherwise, an attacker could send a long frame where the initial datawas a known value (such as all zeros), compute the masking key beingused upon receipt of the first part of the data, and then modify thedata that is yet to be sent in the frame to appear as an HTTP requestwhen masked.  (This is essentially the same problem described in theprevious paragraph with using a known or predictable masking key.)
   If additional data is to be sent or data to be sent is somehowchanged, that new or changed data must be sent in a new frame andthus with a new masking key.  In short, once transmission of a framebegins, the contents must not be modifiable by the remote scriptapplication).

   The threat model being protected against is one in which the clientsends data that appears to be an HTTP request.  As such, the channelthat needs to be masked is the data from the client to the server.
   The data from the server to the client can be made to look like aresponse, but to accomplish this request, the client must also beable to forge a request.  As such, it was not deemed necessary tomask data in both directions (the data from the server to the clientis not masked).

   Despite the protection provided by masking, non-compliant HTTPproxies will still be vulnerable to poisoning attacks of this type byclients and servers that do not apply masking.

10.4.  Implementation-Specific Limits

   Implementations that have implementation- and/or platform-specificlimitations regarding the frame size or total message size afterreassembly from multiple frames MUST protect themselves againstexceeding those limits.  (For example, a malicious endpoint can tryto exhaust its peer's memory or mount a denial-of-service attack bysending either a single big frame (e.g., of size 2**60) or by sendinga long stream of small frames that are a part of a fragmentedmessage.)  Such an implementation SHOULD impose a limit on framesizes and the total message size after reassembly from multipleframes.


10.5.  WebSocket Client Authentication

   This protocol doesn't prescribe any particular way that servers canauthenticate clients during the WebSocket handshake.  The WebSocketserver can use any client authentication mechanism available to ageneric HTTP server, such as cookies, HTTP authentication, or TLSauthentication.

10.6.  Connection Confidentiality and Integrity

   Connection confidentiality and integrity is provided by running theWebSocket Protocol over TLS (wss URIs).  WebSocket implementationsMUST support TLS and SHOULD employ it when communicating with theirpeers.

   For connections using TLS, the amount of benefit provided by TLSdepends greatly on the strength of the algorithms negotiated duringthe TLS handshake.  For example, some TLS cipher mechanisms don'tprovide connection confidentiality.  To achieve reasonable levels ofprotection, clients should use only Strong TLS algorithms.  "WebSecurity Context: User Interface Guidelines" [W3C.REC-wsc-ui-20100812] discusses what constitutes Strong TLSalgorithms.  [RFC5246] provides additional guidance in Appendix A.5and Appendix D.3.

10.7.  Handling of Invalid Data

   Incoming data MUST always be validated by both clients and servers.
   If, at any time, an endpoint is faced with data that it does notunderstand or that violates some criteria by which the endpointdetermines safety of input, or when the endpoint sees an openinghandshake that does not correspond to the values it is expectinge.g., incorrect path or origin in the client request), the endpointMAY drop the TCP connection.  If the invalid data was received aftera successful WebSocket handshake, the endpoint SHOULD send a Closeframe with an appropriate status code (Section 7.4) before proceedingto _Close the WebSocket Connection_.  Use of a Close frame with anappropriate status code can help in diagnosing the problem.  If theinvalid data is sent during the WebSocket handshake, the serverSHOULD return an appropriate HTTP [RFC2616] status code.

   A common class of security problems arises when sending text datausing the wrong encoding.  This protocol specifies that messages witha Text data type (as opposed to Binary or other types) contain UTF-8-encoded data.  Although the length is still indicated andapplications implementing this protocol should use the length todetermine where the frame actually ends, sending data in an improper encoding may still break assumptions that applications built on topof this protocol may make, leading to anything from misinterpretationof data to loss of data or potential security bugs.

10.8.  Use of SHA-1 by the WebSocket Handshake

   The WebSocket handshake described in this document doesn't depend onany security properties of SHA-1, such as collision resistance orresistance to the second pre-image attack (as described in
   [RFC4270]).

11.1.  Registration of New URI Schemes

11.1.1.  Registration of "ws" Scheme

   A |ws| URI identifies a WebSocket server and resource name.

   URI scheme name ws

   Status Permanent

   URI scheme syntax Using the ABNF [RFC5234] syntax and ABNF terminals from the URI specification [RFC3986]:

           "ws:" "//" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ]

   The &lt;path-abempty&gt; and &lt;query&gt; [RFC3986] components form the resourcename sent to the server to identify the kind of service desired.
   Other components have the meanings described in [RFC3986].

   URI scheme semantics The only operation for this scheme is to open a connection using the WebSocket Protocol.

   Encoding considerations Characters in the host component that are excluded by the syntax defined above MUST be converted from Unicode to ASCII as specified in [RFC3987] or its replacement.  For the purposes of scheme-based normalization, Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) forms of the host component and their conversions to punycode are considered equivalent (see Section 5.3.3 of [RFC3987]).

      Characters in other components that are excluded by the syntax defined above MUST be converted from Unicode to ASCII by first encoding the characters as UTF-8 and then replacing the corresponding bytes using their percent-encoded form as defined in the URI [RFC3986] and Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [RFC3987] specifications.

   The |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header field is used in the WebSocket openinghandshake.  It is sent from the client to the server to provide partof the information used by the server to prove that it received avalid WebSocket opening handshake.  This helps ensure that the serverdoes not accept connections from non-WebSocket clients (e.g., HTTPclients) that are being abused to send data to unsuspecting WebSocketservers.

   The |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header field MUST NOT appear more than oncein an HTTP request.






11.3.2.  Sec-WebSocket-Extensions

   The |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field is used in the WebSocketopening handshake.  It is sent from the client to the server and backfrom the server to the client to confirm the subprotocol of theconnection.  This enables scripts to both select a subprotocol and besure that the server agreed to serve that subprotocol.
   The |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field MAY appear multiple timesin an HTTP request (which is logically the same as a single |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field that contains all values).

   Related information This header field is only used for the WebSocket opening handshake.

   The |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field is used in the WebSocketopening handshake.  It is sent from the client to the server toindicate the protocol version of the connection.  This enablesservers to correctly interpret the opening handshake and subsequentdata being sent from the data, and close the connection if the servercannot interpret that data in a safe manner.  The |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header field is also sent from the server to the client onWebSocket handshake error, when the version received from the clientdoes not match a version understood by the server.  In such a case, the header field includes the protocol version(s) supported by theserver.

   Note that there is no expectation that higher version numbers arenecessarily backward compatible with lower version numbers.

12.  Using the WebSocket Protocol from Other Specifications

   The WebSocket Protocol is intended to be used by anotherspecification to provide a generic mechanism for dynamic author-defined content, e.g., in a specification defining a scripted API.

   Such a specification first needs to _Establish a WebSocketConnection_, providing that algorithm with:

   o  The destination, consisting of a /host/ and a /port/.

   o  A /resource name/, which allows for multiple services to be identified at one host and port.

   o  A /secure/ flag, which is true if the connection is to be encrypted and false otherwise.

   o  An ASCII serialization of an origin [RFC6454] that is being made responsible for the connection.

   o  Optionally, a string identifying a protocol that is to be layered over the WebSocket connection.

   The /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure/ flag are usuallyobtained from a URI using the steps to parse a WebSocket URI'scomponents.  These steps fail if the URI does not specify aWebSocket.

   If at any time the connection is to be closed, then the specificationneeds to use the _Close the WebSocket Connection_ algorithmSection 7.1.1).

   Section 7.1.4 defines when _The WebSocket Connection is Closed_.

   While a connection is open, the specification will need to handle thecases when _A WebSocket Message Has Been Received_ (Section 6.2).

   To send some data /data/ to an open connection, the specificationneeds to _Send a WebSocket Message_ (Section 6.1).
